          G&apos;day ðŸ‘‹! My name is <span className="underline decoration-purple-400 decoration-dashed underline-offset-2 decoration-1">Muhammad Oka</span>.
          Currently a third-year computer science student at the University of Queensland.
          My journey into computer science began in first grade elementary when I joined the school&apos;s robotics club, igniting a lifelong curiosity for technology.

          Outside of academic obligations, I do side-projects as a playground to solidify my understanding in computer science and explore new technologies.
          Some topics I am currently interested are <span className="underline decoration-purple-400 decoration-dashed underline-offset-2 decoration-1">Cyber Security</span>, <span className="underline decoration-purple-400 decoration-dashed underline-offset-2 decoration-1">Cloud Infrastructure</span>, and <span className="underline decoration-purple-400 decoration-dashed underline-offset-2 decoration-1">Web Development</span>.
          I also like to participate in capture-the-flag competitions from time to time, mainly solving Forensics and Web Exploitation challenges.
